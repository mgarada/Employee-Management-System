# Employee-Management-System
## Makefile 
### Description 
This is a C program consisting of two source code files, 'cmsc257-p2.c' and 'p2-support.c', as well as a Makefile used to compile the program. 

### Requirements 
To build and run this program, you will need:

- A C compiler (such as 'gcc')
- 'make'

### Usage 
To build the program, run the following command:
```
make
```
This will compile the program using the 'gcc' compiler and create an executable file named 'p2'.

To run the program, use the following command:
```
./p2
```
To clean up the program, use the following command:

```
make clean 
```
This will remove the 'p2' executable as well as any object files created during compilation.
